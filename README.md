# Categorization_Models

General Python code for Minda &amp; Smith's Prototype model and Nosofsky's GCM


* Each model can load a stimulus file, run 1-N monte carlo simulations with random configurations of weights &
scaling parameters, plots the results (individual or average) and save the predictions to a text file.

* The repo also contains two chapters that explain how the model works.
